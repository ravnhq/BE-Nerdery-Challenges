/*
    Challenge 1: "Make a request with retries"
    
    The function makeRequest under utils/make-requests accepts a number representing the number of attempts to make a request. If the request fails, it should retry up to the specified number of attempts. If all attempts fail, it should return an error message.
    
    Requirements:
    - You should work only within the method in this file
    - The function should accept a number representing the number of attempts.
    - The function should make a request and retry if it fails.
    - If all attempts fail, it should return an error message.
    - The function should not modify the original number of attempts.
    - The function should handle network errors gracefully.
    - The function should not use any external libraries.

    Example:
    makeRequestWithRetries(3); // Expected output: "Request successful on attempt X" or "All attempts failed."

const makeRequest = require("./utils/make-requests");

const makeRequestWithRetries = (attempts) => {
  let currentAttempt = 1;

  const tryRequest = () => {
    makeRequest(currentAttempt, (err, result) => {
      if (err)
      {
        if (currentAttempt < attempts) 
        {
          currentAttempt++;
          tryRequest();
        }
        else
        {
          console.error("All attempts failed");
        }
      }
      else
      {
        console.log(result);
      }
    });
